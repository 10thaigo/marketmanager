# Market Manager

Market Manager is a Desktop Application which is in constantly developing to improve my C# and programming skills.
It's being developed using Windows Forms and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
It doesn't connect to the database. Business data is stored in various JSON files.
It features custom-designed user controls.

To handle the JSON data, I use the library called Newtonsoft.Json.
For buttons with icons, I use the library called FontAwesome.Sharp.
